# PovertyAnalysis-CSR-Management
	  ................................................
Leveraging census data with machine learning for targeted funding and poverty alleviation initiatives, optimizing resource allocation for effective 
socio-economic impact.

# Prerequisites
Before using the Poverty Analysis Module, ensure you have the following:

1. Python: The module is written in Python, so ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/

2. Required Libraries: Make sure you have the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip, Python's package manager:

    - NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python.
      ```
      pip install numpy
      ```
    - pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
      ```
      pip install pandas
      ```
    - scikit-learn: A machine learning library that includes various algorithms and tools for data mining and analysis.
      ```
      pip install scikit-learn
      ```
    - Streamlit: A framework for building interactive web applications with Python.
      ```
      pip install streamlit
      ```
3. Census Data: You'll need census data or any relevant dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV) for conducting poverty analysis. Ensure you have access to this dataset before using the module.

4. Python Environment: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and isolate your project's environment. You can create a virtual environment using virtualenv or conda.

Once you have fulfilled these prerequisites, you're ready to use the Poverty Analysis Module for targeted funding and poverty eradication using machine learning techniques.

#Steps

1) Download Program Files: Obtain all necessary program files from the provided zip archive.

2) Install XAMPP Control Panel: Download and install XAMPP Control Panel, a tool that provides an easy way to manage Apache, MySQL, FileZilla, and other components.

3) Start XAMPP Services: Launch XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

4) Access MySQL Admin Page: Open your web browser and navigate to the MySQL administration page provided by XAMPP.

5) Import Databases:

   On the MySQL administration page, navigate to the import section.
   Choose the database file from the downloaded program files. (Employee Management, Inventory Management, Expense Management)
   Click the "Import" button to import the selected database into MySQL.

6) Start Website: Access the website hosted at https://helping-hands-poverty.netlify.app/ which has been deployed by our us using Netlify.

7) If prompted with a "Get the App Back Up" screen, simply click the blue button and wait for a couple of minutes for the process to complete.

8) Now, you can utilize the provided features to predict and analyze poverty levels and manage Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives effectively.

9) After poverty prediction, user can access three modules i.e, Employee Management, Inventory Management and Expense Management.
